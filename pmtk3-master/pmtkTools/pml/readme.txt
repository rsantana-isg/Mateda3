Functions in this folder are related to my book
"Machine learning: a probabilistic approach"
(see http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook/index.html)
and are unlikely to be of interest to anyone else.
Nevertheless they are made public in case anyone else
wants to modify them for their own purposes.
(PML stands for "Probabilistic Machine Learning".)
