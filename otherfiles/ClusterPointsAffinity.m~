% ClusterPointsAffinity:  Clusters a data set using Affinity propagation and a given similarity
%                         measure (the opposite of the given distance)
%                         Features with strong similarity will be clustered together
%                         It is guaranteed that all clusters have at least a
%                         minimum number of points. The number of clusters
%                         is automaticly computed by the algorithm. If
%                         affinity propagation does not converge, only one
%                         cluster is given.
% INPUT
% data: A vector of data were rows are observations and columns are
% features
% distance: Distance used for clustering (e.g. 'euclidean', 'correlation', 'cosine' ... See help pdist for full list of
%                          possible metrics)
% min_size_cluster: Minimum number of solutions in each cluster.
% OUTPUT
% index: Cluster each solution belongs to
% nclusters: Number of clusters
