 59		Rear-Wheel Drive? (1=yes, 0=no)
 61- 66	Suggested Retail Price, what the manufacturer thinks the

		automaker and the dealer (U.S. Dollars)
 68- 73	Dealer Cost (or "invoice price"), what the dealership pays
		the manufacturer (U.S. Dollars)
 75- 77	Engine Size (liters)
 79- 80	Number of Cylinders (=-1 if rotary engine)

RELATED DATASETS:

A similar dataset appeared as one of the sample datasets shipped with the _Student Edition of Execustat_ (PWS-KENT 1990).

Another similar dataset, submitted by Robin Lock, may be found in the _Journal of Statistics Education_ dataset archive at 
http://www.amstat.org/publications/ jse/datasets/93cars.dat. The accompanying article "1993 New Car Data", Journal of 
Statistics Education, vol. 1, no. 1, by Lock (1993) may be found at the site 
http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v1n1/datasets.lock.html.

COMMENTS ON MISSING VALUES:
Length and Width of pickup trucks were not given in _Kiplinger's_. Possible updates to the dataset (viewable on a vehicle 
by vehicle basis) may be found at the site http://www.kiplinger.com/tools/carfinder/; these updates may allow some of the 
missing values to be filled in.

PEDAGOGICAL NOTES:
This is a multi-purpose dataset that can be used at many points in an introductory statistics course. It includes several 
numeric variables which can be examined across a choice of several categorical variables. Students tend to be familiar with 
most of the variables. Furthermore, they also tend to be able to anticipate and pose explanations for many of the 
relationships between variables. Suggested Retail Price/Dealer Cost and the two MPG variables are popular choices as 
response variables. One suggested exploration - try fitting the MPG variables as linear in reciprocal weight (clear 
outliers to this strongly linear pattern are the hybrid gas/electric cars). Other explorations are suggested in the 
article of Lock (1993) referenced above.
