The projects directory is for experimental projects that use pmtk3, but which
are not meant for general use by the public. Thus they are usually undocumented
projects that essentially are 'free riding' off the code sharing facilities
offered by googlecode.com. These projects are not part of the 'unit testing'
framework (runDemos, debugDemos, etc).
