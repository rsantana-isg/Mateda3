For a preliminary explanation of Mateda see the file Mateda2.0-UserGuide.pdf in this directory.
General documentation about the programs is available in the /doc directory or from:
http://www.sc.ehu.es/ccwbayes/members/rsantana/software/matlab/MATEDA.html

MATEDA3.0 employs the Matlab Bayes Net (BNT) toolbox (Murphy:2001) and the pmtk3-master library (https://github.com/probml/pmtk3) which have been included within the Mateda3 repository 
Some of the MATEDA3.0 routines also employs the MATLAB statistical toolbox and the affinity propagation  clustering algorithm (Frey_and_Dueck:2007)

To start the library: 
 1) Edit file InitEnvironment.m updating the path path_MATEDA
  
 2) Set the current Matlab directory to the MATEDA3 directory.
 
 3) Execute program InitEnvironments.m.


The folder ScriptsMateda contains several  examples of EDAs implementations. The file Mateda2.0-UserGuide.pdf contains a detailed explanation of how to use the programs.
