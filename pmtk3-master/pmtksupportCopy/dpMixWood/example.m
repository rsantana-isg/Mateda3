% now we have some high dimensional "spikes," let's make them low
% dimensional using PCA  -- N.B. as PCA is a linear projection it makes no

% is nearly always a step that needs to happen in the chain -- PCA is but
% one option.  Manual feature selection can work well in this step as well

% OK, now we have reduced_dimensionality_waveforms.  Let's set up the
% priors for model estimation.  In this case we have the advantage of
% knowing the hyperparameters used in generating the data (and that the
% data truly comes from a mixture of gaussians model), but let's say we
% didn't.  The model requires us to specify:
%
%   \Lambda_0^{-1} : our prior for per-neuron spike variability about it's
%                    mean spike
%   v_0 : how much confidence we have in this prior (must be greater than
%   spike_dimensions_to_retain for mathematical reasons)
%   mu_0 : the mean waveform for a particular cell
%   k_0 : how much confidence we have in this prior
%   a_0, b_0 : gamma(a_0, b_0) on the CRP concentration parameter alpha
%
% Even though these parameters have reasonably clear interpretations, it still 
% can be difficult to hand-specify them (although this is really the way they should
% be specified, i.e. carefully designed to match your understanding about how much 
% variability spike waveform shape has, etc.  If you don't want to go through with this
% reasonable heuristic fall-back is to repeatedly sample from the model's
% prior until the samples "look like" your data.  I _highly_ recommend that
% you run the section below many, many times to develop an intuition for
% how the model hyperparameters affect things.  Run it multiple times for
% the same hyperparameter values to see the "distribution," then change
% hyperparameter values and do it again to gauge the effect of different
% hyperparameters on the prior.

% Starting here is the real meat of the spike sorter.  _One_ out of many possible
% usage scenarios are considered:  here a small subset of the overall spikes is
% processed using offline estimation and then online techniques are used to integrate
% the remainder of the data into the model estimate.  The following code could easily
% be rearranged to use offline estimation to estimate the posterior given all spikes 
% or to use online estimation to estimate the posterior given all spikes one by one.

% ... once you have hyperparameters that work for your data it's time to start model
% estimation.  There could be an enormous amount of data so some subsampling of the
% data is done first.  Here we'll take the first 1000 datapoints to start model
% estimation.  Doing this is _not necessary_ and particle filter estimation
% can be used from the start (or gibbs sampling can be applied to the entire dataset),

% now that we have handled all of the "in-sample" datapoints, we now should
% integrate the "out of sample" waveforms.  We could  just as well run the 
% Gibbs sampler again, but this time with all of the waveforms instead of 
% just the first "in-sample" datapoints.  Instead to do this we switch to
% sequential posterior estimation through particle filtering.
% *Important note* -- the next two lines of code are tied fairly tightly to
% the previous code.  If you want to disconnect the particle filter from the Gibbs
% sampler in order to run only the particle filter then num_particles can
% be set to any value (higher is good, infinite is exact).  The particle
% filter suffers from one drawback, namely, alpha is instead
% treated as a parameter instead of a random variable.  This is a difficult

% You're done!  Now all of the data has been integrated into the model as we now have 
% (weighted) set of sampled spike sortings.  Now comes the hard part.  One
% can simply take the MAP spike sorting (spike sorting with the highest
% weight) but that throws away basically the entire point of having gone
% through all of this in the first point.  Instead, analyses should be run
% on all spike sortings and then averaged: something like this:

% for n=1:num_particles
%     result(n) = perform_averagable_analysis(spike_sorting(n),
%     per_spike_side_information_like_spike_timing_and_or_stimulus);
% end
% average_result = result.*spike_sorting_weights;

% just for the fun of it though, let's look at the MAP sample

% if you compare this to figure 1 you will notice that the colors assigned
% to each class are probably different -- that's because the distribution
% is invariant to permutations of the labeling (the labeling of which
% neuron each spike is attributed to).  This is _extremely consequential_
% to the design of analyses that use the entire posterior distribution.
% Although it may _happen_ that all of the spike sortings have roughly the
% same labeling scheme, that is definitely _not_ something you should ever
% count on in the use of this spike sorting technique

% and we can repeat neuron cardinality analysis, but this time for weighted
% samples
