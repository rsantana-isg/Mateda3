Probabilistic modeling toolkit version 3
See https://github.com/probml/pmtk3 for details.

Steps:
1. run initPmtk3.m (takes a few minutes)
2. run testPmtk3.m (takes under a minute)
3. run runDemos.m (takes about 1  hour)


The code relies on various external toolboxes (in addition to those in
pmtksupport), listed below:

opt : Mathworks optimization toolbox
stats : Mathworks statistics toolbox
image : Mathworks image processing toolbox
bio : Mathworks bioinformatics toolbox
 gviz:  graphviz
 libdai:  libdai 
 glmnet:  glmnet (Fortran library not  available for maci64)
 libsvm:  libsvm (Matlab inferface)
 UGM:  Mark Schmidt's UGM package

If some of these packages are missing and/or not compiled for your
computer,  some demos may be skipped.
